REACT - QUICK NOTES

* React is a Javascript library used for building user interfaces such as todo list applications

* It allows us to User Interfaces to be complied through components

* The syntax used in React is JSX which structurally is easier to understand and read

* Components allows data entered in React to visually render to our screen.

* In the event, that any data changes, React will update and re-render the components accordingly

* Within a component, props short for properties are entered as data which looks like HTML elements

* They are nested within a render method and returned to display on screen.

* Whilst passing in props, it allows control of information flow in parent and child components

* Components also can have a state (an object) which is bound by its component.

* Often state is used with the keyword this i.e. this.state followed by object key value pairs 

* They are nested within a constructor() method and with a props to be accessed within render elements.

FOR EXAMPLE: 

class Square extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: null,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
        {this.props.value}
      </button>
    );
  }
}

* super will always be used in defining the constructor as it refers to the parent class constructor

* If not included then you won't be able to use the this. to create object nor access within the rest of the code
