REACT - QUICK NOTES

* React is a Javascript library used for building user interfaces such as todo list applications

* It allows us to User Interfaces to be complied through components

* Components allows data entered in React to visually render to our screen.

* In the event, that any data changes, React will update and re-render the components accordingly

* Within a component, props short for properties are entered as data which looks like HTML elements

* They are nested within a render method and returned to display on screen.

* The syntax used in React is JSX which structurally is easier to understand and read
